                        <h4>1. Let your hair breathe</h4>
                        <p class="subheading-article">As a hijabi, it is understandable that you have to keep your hair
                            in place for the entire day. This means that your hair tends to be tied up in a bun and kept
                            tucked beneath your innerwear. Once you are home, it is best to let your hair loose to allow
                            your hair and scalp to breathe.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading-article">If you have to wear your hijab at home because you live with a
                            non-mahram, be sure to wear your hijab loosely to allow a certain level of breathability for
                            your hair. Also, if you are able to, please allow your hair to breathe and soak up natural
                            surroundings.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph mt-2">
                        <h4>2. Establish a proper shampoo routine</h4>
                        <p class="subheading-article">It can get quite itchy especially when you’re living in humid
                            climates and sweat often. You are highly discouraged from washing your hair every single
                            day. Washing your hair too frequently will strip it of its natural oils. This would lead to
                            dry and brittle hair. It is best to use a leave-in conditioner to allow your hair to soak up
                            moisture. Alternatively, you might want to consider using dry shampoos to refresh your
                            scalp.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading-article">The Shampoo Lounge has Virgin Coconut Oil Creambath. Try the
                            traditional Indonesian ladies secret for long, healthy and shiny hair.Includes: head, neck,
                            upper body massage, deep conditioning hair treatment with Virgin Coconut oil and foot scrub.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading-article">Moreover, try your best to avoid hot showers. I know it sounds
                            tempting especially if you’re in a colder climate. Hot showers wreck havoc for your hair as
                            hot water can be harsh on your scalp and hair. As mentioned earlier, hot showers will leave
                            your hair dry and cause breakage. A cold shower is advisable because it temporarily closes
                            your pores and flattens your hair follicles. Hence, this will increase their ability to grip
                            to your scalp and reduce hair loss.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph mt-2">
                        <h4>3. Know your hair type</h4>
                        <p class="subheading-article">
                            Each Muslimah has different hair. Whether it is straight, curly or wavy, it is vital for you
                            to understand your hair needs. Your hair type will determine how often you need to wash it
                            and the right products to use. For those with straight hair, you may be able to get away
                            with washing your hair every day but be sure to use a conditioner every four or five days.
                            Muslimahs with curly or wavy hair are advised to wash their hair three times a week and
                            conditioning it every one or two times.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading-article">Say hello to fresh ends when you trim your hair. You don’t have to
                            get a significant haircut but regular hair trims are best to get rid of split ends. It is
                            recommended to get a trim every four to six weeks which ensures your hair grows healthily.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph mt-2">
                        <h4>4. Use the right products and tools</h4>
                        <p class="subheading-article">
                            Natural products are highly recommended as they do not contain artificial chemicals. Natural
                            oils such as argan oil and coconut oil are great natural products to nourish your hair minus
                            all the grease. The right natural oil for your hair type will ensure your scalp is soothed
                            and moisturized. It will also give your hair a natural shine.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading-article">Use natural combs and brushes too as it would be gentler on your
                            hair and will help distribute your natural hair oils evenly. This would significantly
                            prevent hair fall and breakage. Plus, combing your hair promotes circulation and a healthy
                            scalp.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph mt-2">
                        <h4>5. Wrap your hair when you sleep</h4>
                        <p class="subheading-article">
                            This tip might seem counterintuitive to the first hair tip. But wrapping your hair with a
                            silk scarf will help retain your hair’s moisture especially if your hair is already fragile.
                            Silk scarves or silk pillows will aid in controlling your hair sebum.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading-article">Otherwise, your hair may lose its natural moisture when you sleep
                            and end up producing more oil to compensate for the loss. This might not be obvious
                            overnight but it is better to take consistent steps long term.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph mt-2">
                        <h4>6. Dry your hair before wearing your hijab</h4>
                        <p class="subheading-article">
                            Sometimes it may seem like you have so many steps to get through before putting on your
                            hijab. But drying your hair is vital to prevent any damage to the roots of your hair
                            especially when you tie your hair when it’s wet. Plus, your hair will be tied up for the
                            rest of the day with little chance of it drying. You will end up with “hijab hair” where
                            your hair is all flat and limp at the end of the day and not to mention the odour you would
                            have to deal with.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading-article"> If possible, give yourself ample time for your hair to air dry.
                            However, if you are in a
                            rush or live in colder climates where it would be tougher to air dry it, be sure to blow dry
                            it sparingly.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph mt-2">
                        <h4>7. Be mindful on how you tie your hair</h4>
                        <p class="subheading-article">
                            It is understandable that hijabis would like to keep their hair secure throughout the day to
                            ensure any escaping strands. However, tying your hair tightly could cause receding hairlines
                            in the long run. It is also important to note that tying your hair the same way each day
                            will lead to hair breakage.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading-article">
                            Instead of elastic ties, you could opt for scrunchies to lighten the strain on your hair.
                            You could either go for lower and looser buns or for at least one day a week, tie your hair
                            a little looser. This would prevent straining of the roots of your hair from constantly
                            being pulled back. Or to change things up a bit, you could braid your hair as it is a
                            gentler way of keeping your hair tied back. On the bright side, when you’re home, you can
                            unravel your crown in glory.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph mt-2">
                        <h4>8. Change and wash your innerwear regularly</h4>
                        <p class="subheading-article">
                            This tip seems obvious but it doesn’t hurt to remind you. Since your innerwear are worn all
                            day, dandruff and dust could easily build up underneath as it comes in direct contact with
                            your hair. For the health of your hair, it is important to keep it clean and fresh. It is
                            best to have two-three innerwear in the rotation.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph mt-2">
                        <h4>9. Choose the best hijab for you</h4>
                        <p class="subheading-article">
                            Be mindful of your hijab style and the material of your hijab. Moreover, it is
                            understandable that you would like to try out the latest hijab trends. Your hijab style is a
                            personal one but it is important to note what feels good on you. Be aware of what material
                            of your hijab that is suitable for you.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading-article"> Hijab comes in various materials such as cotton, silk, satin and
                            jersey. Put your needs
                            first when selecting a hijab. You will need something that is breathable and not too tight
                            to prevent hair loss.
                        </p>
                        <p class="subheading-article"> Don’t sweep your hair care issues under your hijab. It might be
                            out of sight but it should
                            not be out of mind. Your hair deserves the same amount of love as your scarves. So, say
                            goodbye to your hijab hair woes!
